This react native app uses Ethers.js, Etherspot and Redux to build a simple mobile app that enables wallet generation and recovery, visualization of balance and the ability to send ETH to another address. 
It is currently working with an Infura Node on the Goerli testnet. 
It has 4 screens in order to make it more user-friendly.
Tested on an android emulator (v31, Android 12(S)).
